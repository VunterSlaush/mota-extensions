# Poteto Mode for Mota Editor

A pure-data extension that brings a rigorous agent mode to Mota. It is an
adaptation of [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack)
by Lauren Tan (MIT), the Cursor plugin behind `/poteto-mode`.

Type `/poteto-mode <goal>` in any chat. The agent reads a principles
index, matches your goal to a playbook, copies the playbook's steps into
its todo list, delegates bounded steps to sub-agents by model tier, and
reports done only with verbatim evidence. The mode is sticky by
instruction: "continue" resumes the playbook, "new task" re-matches, and
"exit poteto mode" turns it off.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/poteto-mode <goal>` | The front door. Principles, playbook match, todo list, tiered delegation, evidence before done. |
| `/how <subsystem>` | Walk through how something works from real code, with file:line hops. |
| `/why <thing>` | Why it was built this way, from ADRs and git history, with sources. |
| `/architect <change>` | Design a boundary-crossing change: callers, shapes, ownership, finish check. |
| `/arena [N] <task>` | N isolated parallel attempts, judged by a separate model. |
| `/interrogate [target]` | Adversarial multi-lens review. Only confirmed findings survive. |
| `/tdd <bug>` | Failing test first, smallest fix, both outputs quoted. |
| `/figure-it-out <goal>` | Bespoke phased plan with checkable finish conditions. |
| `/show-me-your-work [path]` | Append a decision log a reviewer can audit. |
| `/unslop [target]` | Strip filler from code or prose without changing behavior. |

Playbooks bundled inside `/poteto-mode`: Investigation, Bug fix, Feature,
Refactoring, Performance issue, Prototype, Runtime forensics, Opening a PR,
Autonomous run, Multi-phase plan, Session pickup, Worktree cleanup.

## Install

1. Copy this folder to `~/.mota/extensions/poteto-mode/`
   (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.mota\extensions\poteto-mode\`), or ship it
   with a repo under `<project>/.mota/extensions/poteto-mode/`.
2. In Mota: Settings, Extensions, Reload list, then Approve. The only
   permission is `commands:register`. No process is started.
3. Optional, for Claude Code tabs: copy `agents/poteto-agent.md` into
   `<project>/.claude/agents/` or `~/.claude/agents/`. The main prompt
   then delegates implementation and investigation steps to that
   sub-agent. Without it the agent uses the harness default sub-agent and
   pastes the principles into each brief.

If a command name collides with one you already have, Mota lists it as
`/poteto-mode.<name>`, and the qualified form always works.

## Permissions and network

- `commands:register`: the only permission. It lets the extension add the
  slash commands above. There is no process, no script, and no network
  call. Nothing runs on your machine except the prompt text the agent
  receives.

## What is prompt-level and what is enforced

Everything here is prompt text. Mota expands the command client-side and
sends it as the turn's prompt, so:

- The todo list is the agent's own plan tool. Mota renders it in the Plan
  panel when the provider reports it, but nothing blocks a step.
- "Evidence before done" is an instruction, not a gate. Mota has no hook
  that runs tests before a reply. If you want a hard gate, that is a
  Mota feature, not an extension.
- Model tiering depends on the harness. Claude Code's sub-agent tool
  accepts a model per agent, so tiers apply there. Codex and Gemini
  inherit the session model.
- Stickiness lives in the conversation. A fresh chat starts without the
  mode until you type `/poteto-mode` again.

## Editing

Each command is a markdown file under `prompts/`. `$ARGUMENTS` is
replaced with whatever follows the command. Edit in place and press
Reload in Settings, Extensions. Files are read whole, so do not add YAML
frontmatter to them.
